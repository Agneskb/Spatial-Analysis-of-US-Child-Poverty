This project investigates the determinants and spatial distribution of child poverty across counties in the United States, focusing on economic, demographic, and geographic factors. Using data from the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE), the Area Health Resources File, and the American Community Survey, the study employs both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and spatial regression models to capture spatial dependencies that traditional models overlook.
