This project investigates the determinants and spatial distribution of child poverty across counties in the United States, focusing on economic, demographic, and geographic factors. Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE), the Area Health Resources File, and the American Community Survey, the study employs both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and spatial regression models to capture spatial dependencies that traditional models overlook.

Key findings reveal that child poverty is significantly influenced by family structure, socioeconomic conditions, and geographic context. Higher percentages of single-parent households, lower household incomes, and lower parental education levels are positively associated with higher child poverty rates. Spatial analysis demonstrates substantial regional clustering, with poverty rates highest in the central Appalachia, Mississippi Delta, and Black Belt regions. The Moran’s I statistic confirms spatial autocorrelation, emphasizing the need for spatially-aware modeling techniques.
